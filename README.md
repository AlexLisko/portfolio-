# Alex J. Lisko — Portfolio

Personal portfolio site showcasing my work in UX Research, Human Factors, and product systems. 
## Why I Built This
My background is in user research and human factors, where I focus on understanding user behavior and translating insight into actionable direction.

I built this portfolio to show that research-led practitioners can also ship. This project reflects my ability to take a system from concept through implementation and deployment, applying the same rigor I bring to research — attention to detail, iteration, and real-world constraints — to a live, production experience.

It’s both a showcase of my work and a demonstration of how I think, build, and deliver end-to-end.

## Local Development
```bash
# open index.html in browser


3. Commit directly to `main`

✅ Safe — Netlify will redeploy but nothing breaks.

## 2️⃣ Rename weird / duplicate files (optional but nice)

Right now you have:
- `Alex Lisko — Portfolio.html`
- `index.html`

### Recommendation:
- **Keep:** `index.html`
- **Remove:** `Alex Lisko — Portfolio.html` (duplicate / unused)

To delete in GitHub:
1. Click the file
2. Click 🗑️ **Delete**
3. Commit

⚠️ Only do this if you’re sure Netlify loads `index.html` (it does).

## 3️⃣ Organize images (clean & future-proof)

You already started this 👏
